# Service Worker Auth

Simple service worker that authenticates the user.

I am implementing the service-worker with Vite. I can use the Wayne library for the service worker but I wanted to implement the service worker myself because I've never worked with one. I also chose to register the service worker manually rather than with a library/package, which of course exists - (register-service-worker)
